All teams, players, and coaches participating in the tournament are deemed to have read, understood, and fully accepted the rules in this document.

### **2. Organization and Authority**
IstanbuLAN 2026 is organized by the Istanbul Esports Initiative, and all broadcasting, brand, and operational rights of the event belong to the organization. The tournament administration has the authority to make the final decision on all matters, including format, match schedule, matchups, rule interpretations, and disciplinary processes.

In cases not explicitly regulated in this rule set, the organization makes decisions based on the principles of “competitive integrity” and “equal treatment”. Decisions are irreversible unless explicitly stated otherwise and are binding for all participants.

### **3. Participation Conditions and Player Eligibility**
Every team wishing to participate in the tournament is obliged to provide accurate and up-to-date information during the registration process. Each player must use a Steam account that belongs to them, has access to Counter-Strike 2, and has no active VAC or official game bans. Account sharing and playing a match with another player's account is strictly prohibited; this is considered a severe violation and may result in the team's disqualification.

The tournament is primarily open to players aged 16 and over. For players under the age of 18, additional documents such as parental/guardian consent may be requested depending on the country's legislation. Players who cannot provide the necessary documents cannot participate in the tournament; teams cannot hold the organization responsible for deficiencies arising from this reason.

### **4. Team Rosters and Roster Rules**
Each team may register for the tournament with a maximum of five (5) players and preferably one (1) coach. Players outside of these individuals are not considered the official roster throughout the tournament and cannot play in any match.

#### **4.1 Roster Lock and Core Roster**
Fourteen (14) days before the start date of the LAN playoff stage, the roster lock for the tournament comes into effect. After this date, teams cannot make free changes to their rosters. After the roster lock, each team must keep at least three of the first five registered players in the roster. This “3/5 core” rule is mandatory for both the protection of rights earned in online qualifiers and VRS compliance.

#### **4.2 Stand-in and Emergency Changes**
In mandatory cases, such as health problems, travel restrictions, or similar reasonable and documentable situations, the team may change the remaining two players provided they protect the three players in the core. These changes are valid only with the prior notification and written approval of the tournament administration. When deemed necessary, reports, travel documents, or similar evidentiary documents may be requested.

Coaches are responsible for the team's preparation and tactical planning; they are prohibited from establishing voice communication with players while live rounds are being played. It is also prohibited for coaches to give directions regarding the in-game situation, strategy, or round during technical timeouts and pauses given by the admin. Coaches may only communicate with players during tactical timeouts and halftimes.

### **5. Registration Process**
Registrations for open qualifiers are received via the registration form on the organization's official website (istanbulan.gg), and applications are sorted on a “first-come, first-serve” basis. Information requested during registration must be filled in completely. Teams providing false or misleading information may be unilaterally removed from the tournament by the organization.

The registration fee is determined as $500 + VAT per team (5 players and optional 1 coach). Taxation will be invoiced according to the country of the applying team. After teams fill out the registration form, they will be contacted to confirm the payment method. A team's place in the tournament is only finalized when the payment is successfully completed. Teams that do not pay the fee by the deadline may be replaced by reserve teams in line. Refund conditions are specified separately on the registration page; in the event that a team withdraws from the tournament of its own preference, the organization is not obliged to make a refund.

2. Mirage
3. Nuke
4. Ancient
5. Overpass
6. Dust2
7. Train

Map veto and side selection are applied for BO1 and BO3 series such that the Higher Seed in the matchup has priority. The map banning process takes place as follows:

* Team B removes 1 map.
* Team A removes 1 map.
* Team B removes 1 map.

  * Team A chooses the starting side on Map 2.
* Team B removes 1 map.
* Team A removes 1 map.
* The remaining map becomes Map 3 (decider).
  * Team B chooses the starting side on Map 3.

### **9. Check-in, Punctuality and No-Show**
In the open qualifier stage, teams are obliged to be ready in the lobby at the match times specified on FACEIT. If the reasonable delay time given by the platform is exceeded, a win by default may be awarded to the opposing team.

In the LAN stage, teams must come to the arena and complete check-in procedures at the times determined by the organization before the day their first matches will be played. Identity checks and accreditation of each player may be done individually. Teams must be ready in the arena with all their players at least two (2) hours before their first matches.

On a match basis, admins may grant a delay tolerance of maximum 10–15 minutes for teams that do not connect to the server on time. If this time is exceeded, the relevant map or series may be considered lost by default. Teams that do not show up for the match at all are evaluated as “no-show,” and the opposing team is declared the winner of the series.

### **10. Timeouts, Technical Issues, and Round Restore**
In total, timeouts are handled under 3 main headings: Tactical timeout, Technical timeout, and Admin Pause.

Each team has three (3) tactical timeouts per map; the duration of each timeout is 30 seconds. In the event of going to Overtime, teams are granted one (1) additional tactical timeout right. Tactical timeouts are called via in-game command, and teams may use timeouts consecutively if they wish.

Technical timeouts may be requested by players in cases of hardware failure, disconnection, and similar technical malfunctions. Players must inform the admin immediately in such a case. Talking strategy during a technical timeout is prohibited; the timeout is only for resolving the problem. If the team cannot resolve the technical problem within the time given to them, the tournament administration may decide to have the team play as is or expel the team from the tournament if they cannot continue.

Admin Pause is when admins stop the game in case of any problem. Admin Pause is used to resolve disputes, server problems, or any problem related to the area in a LAN environment. Players, coaches, and team staff must not move from their places during this time and must wait for the problem to be resolved. Talking strategy during an Admin Pause is prohibited. Coaches cannot speak during an Admin Pause.

Round restore is applied only under certain conditions. Generally, a round can be restarted for interruptions occurring within the first seconds after freeze time, provided no damage has been dealt and the bomb has not been planted. Otherwise, the game continues from where it left off when the disconnected player is able to reconnect. In more serious situations such as a server crash or all players losing connection simultaneously, the last completed round score is reverted to using CS2’s match restore tools as much as possible. Round Restore is not performed for situations arising from player errors.

### **11. Player Equipment and Setup**
In the LAN stage, the tournament organization provides gaming computers, monitors, audio solutions, and workspaces for all teams. Players may bring their own mouse, keyboard, mousepad, and in-ear headphones, but the equipment brought will be expected to meet the organization's safety and compatibility criteria.

IstanbuLAN 2026 will provide two PC spec sets for the players and assign them accordingly. Please note that while the hardware specifications may vary, all teams will play on identical setups when facing each other. This ensures a fair and balanced environment for all participants during the matches.

Protests regarding issues evident during gameplay will not be accepted if submitted after the match has concluded. Administrators will review available evidence, including demos and logs, to issue a ruling.
